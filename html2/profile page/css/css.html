        <h1 class="a">I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.</h1>
        <h7 id="y">Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.</p>
        <h5 id="b">A room without books is like a body without a soul.</p>
        <h4 class="c">Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.</p>
        <h1 align="left">You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
            Love like you'll never be hurt,
            Sing like there's nobody listening,
            And live like it's heaven on earth.</p>
